        <h2>Learning more about our pet companion</h2>
		<h4>History of Cats</h4>
		</br>
		<p> Cats have been a part of human history for thousands of years. They were first domesticated
		in the Near East around 10,000 years ago, where they were valued for their ability to keep rodents
		at bay.</br> The ancient Egyptians worshipped cats as sacred animals, and they were often depicted in art
		and mummified alongside their owners.
        </br> In medieval Europe, cats were associated with witchcraft and the devil, and were often persecuted
		as a result. However, they were also kept as pets and as rat-catchers in homes and on ships.
		</br>During the 18th and 19th centuries, cats became popular pets in Europe and North America.
		Cat breeds were developed and cat shows were held, showcasing the many different colors and
		patterns that cats can have.
		</br>Today, cats are one of the most popular pets in the world, with an estimated 600 million
		domesticated cats worldwide. They are beloved for their independence, affectionate nature,
		and ability to provide comfort and companionship to their owners.</p>

		<h4>History of Dogs</h4>
		</br>
		<p>Dogs have been domesticated for thousands of years, with the exact date and location of their
		domestication still under debate among scientists. Some suggest that dogs were first domesticated
		in Europe around 15,000 years ago, while others believe that it may have happened in Asia or the Middle
		East.</br>
        Regardless of where and when it happened, dogs have played an important role in human history. They have
		been bred for a variety of purposes, including hunting, herding, guarding, and companionship.</br> In ancient
		times, dogs were often used in war, and they were highly valued by many civilizations, including the Greeks
		and Romans.</br> During the Middle Ages, dogs were used for hunting, and many new breeds were developed for this 
		purpose.</br> In the 19th century, dogs began to be bred more for companionship, and many of the modern breeds we
		know today were developed during this time.</br> Today, dogs are one of the most popular pets in the world, with
		an estimated 470 million domesticated dogs worldwide. They continue to play important roles in society,
		including as working animals for law enforcement and search and rescue, as well as beloved family pets.</p>

		<h4>History of Hamster</h4>
		</br>
		<p>Hamsters are small rodents that have been kept as pets for over 70 years. The first hamsters to be domesticated
		were Syrian hamsters, which were originally found in the deserts of Syria and other parts of the Middle East.
		</br>In 1930, a zoologist named Israel Aharoni discovered a family of Syrian hamsters in the Syrian desert and brought
		them back to Israel. These hamsters were bred in captivity and became popular pets in Europe and the United States
		in the 1940s and 1950s.Since then, many other species of hamsters have been domesticated and kept as pets, including
		dwarf hamsters, Chinese hamsters, and Russian hamsters.</br>Hamsters are known for their small size and cute, cuddly
		appearance. They are also popular as pets because they are easy to care for and relatively low-maintenance. Hamsters
		are active and playful animals that require plenty of exercise, so they are often kept in cages with wheels and other
		toys.</br>Overall, hamsters have become an important part of the pet industry and continue to be a popular choice for pet
		owners around the world.</p>
